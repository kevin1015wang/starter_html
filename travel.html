            </h3>
            <p>
                On October 8, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire occurred destroying many buildings, miles of street, and leaving one-third of the city’s population homeless. The result of this was the “Great Rebuilding” which was a time period of heightened level of construction, new styles of architecture, innovative buildings, and sprouting economic growth. More than one hundred years ago, the world’s first double-deck trunnion bascule bridge opened on West Lake street. The towers and buildings around this bridge are different types of corporate offices, firms, business centers, restaurants, stores, apartments, condominiums, and hotels along with parks and tourist attractions. </p>
            <p>
                What makes Chicago unique compared to all the other cities in the United States is that it has the most bridges, it inspired Gotham City, world renowned pieces of art, skyscrapers with multiple architectural styles, and the flow of the river is reversed. What once was a rail yard and parking lot, transformed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to become the Millenium Park to celebrate the passage of the second millennium. The Navy Pier was created with the intention of being a shipping and recreation facility and later evolved into premiere entertainment and exposition center. Due to the anti-Chinese sentiment and Chinese immigrants escaping violence, the Chinatown Square opened in 1993 from the efforts of Chinese activists demanding more land.
