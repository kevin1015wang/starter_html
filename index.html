                            our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come

                            greet visitors with a smile and a few barks. </p>
                        <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention

                            him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small

                            he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

                            Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite
                            being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be
                            difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy
                            socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
                        </p>

                            Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor,
                            doing
                            tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His
                            favorite
                            hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at
                            the
                            end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.

                            Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks
                            and
                            treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him
                            playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
                            cooling

                            He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky
                            gets
                            really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when

                            hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as

                            as he likes to play.
