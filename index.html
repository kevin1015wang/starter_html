                <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around
                    our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and
                    greet visitors with a smile and a few barks. </p>
                <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from
                    him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle,
                    he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

                    Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite
                    being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be
                    difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy
                    socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing
                    tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite
                    hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the
                    end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.

                    Jiji is a one year old gray tabby cat born in Miami, FL. She was adopted when she was a few
                    weeks old. Her birthday is July 2nd 2022. Her favorite toy is her fish wand and her second
                    favorite toy is a slinky.

                <p>
                    In her free time she likes to sit on the windowsill and people watch. She also likes to collect
                    any stray ponytails she can find in bathrooms, on the floor, and on bedside tables. She has a
                    very high pitched meow and loves to be brushed.

                <p>
                    Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and
                    treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him
                    playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling
                    off in the garage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets
                    really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s
                    hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much
                    as he likes to play.
                </p>
