                    <p>MiaoMiao is the best cat in the world, extremely social with other, and vigilant against
                        strangers. Oftentimes you can find her running around the house looking for things to eat. If
                        she consumed anything other than cat food, she immediately throws up. </p>
                    <p>She is chill and chirpy. Loves to play with anything other than professional cat toys. Also loves
                        sitting on keyboards and joining Zoom calls.</p>

                    <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around
                        our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and
                        greet visitors with a smile and a few barks. </p>
                    <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from
                        him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle,
                        he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

                        Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite
                        being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be
                        difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy
                        socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing
                        tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite
                        hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the
                        end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.

                        Jiji is a one year old gray tabby cat born in Miami, FL. She was adopted when she was a few weeks old. Her birthday is July 2nd 2022. Her favorite toy is her fish wand and her second favorite toy is a slinky.

                    <p>
                        In her free time she likes to sit on the windowsill and people watch. She also likes to collect any stray ponytails she can find in bathrooms, on the floor, and on bedside tables. She has a very high pitched meow and loves to be brushed.

                    <p>
                        Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.
                    </p>
