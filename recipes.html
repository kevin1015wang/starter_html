            <h2>Shrimp Scampi</h2>
            <img src="images/shrimp scampi.jpg" alt ="Shrimp scampi is a classic Italian-American delight, where succulent shrimp meet a medley of garlic, butter, and white wine. Sautéed to pink perfection, the shrimp mingle with a fragrant blend of garlic and red pepper flakes. A drizzle of white wine and a squeeze of lemon create a luxurious sauce, embracing the dish's linguine base. With a sprinkle of parsley, it's a harmonious, flavorful masterpiece that exemplifies both simplicity and taste.
