            <h2 id="main">Shrimp Scampi</h2>
            <img src="images/shrimp scampi.jpg" alt="Shrimp scampi is a classic Italian-American delight, where succulent shrimp meet a medley of garlic, butter, and white wine. Sautéed to pink perfection, the shrimp mingle with a fragrant blend of garlic and red pepper flakes. A drizzle of white wine and a squeeze of lemon create a luxurious sauce, embracing the dish's linguine base. With a sprinkle of parsley, it's a harmonious, flavorful masterpiece that exemplifies both simplicity and taste.

                ½ cup dry white wine or broth
                ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
                ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
                Freshly ground black pepper
                1¾ pounds large or extra-large shrimp, shelled
                ⅓ cup chopped parsley

                Cooked pasta or crusty bread </p>
            <p> Recipe Steps </p>

                crusty bread.
