            <h2 id="main">Shrimp Scampi</h2>
            <img src="images/shrimp_scampi.jpg" alt="Shrimp scampi is a classic Italian-American delight, where succulent shrimp meet a medley of garlic, butter, and white wine. Sautéed to pink perfection, the shrimp mingle with a fragrant blend of garlic and red pepper flakes. A drizzle of white wine and a squeeze of lemon create a luxurious sauce, embracing the dish's linguine base. With a sprinkle of parsley, it's a harmonious, flavorful masterpiece that exemplifies both simplicity and taste." width="400">
            <p> Recipe Ingredients </p>
            <p> 2 tablespoons butter
                2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
                4 garlic cloves, minced
                ½ cup dry white wine or broth
                ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
                ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
                Freshly ground black pepper
                1¾ pounds large or extra-large shrimp, shelled
                ⅓ cup chopped parsley
                Freshly squeezed juice of half a lemon
                Cooked pasta or crusty bread </p>
            <p> Recipe Steps </p>
            <p> In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add
                wine or broth, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Let the wine
                reduce by half, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and sauté until they just turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes
                depending upon their size. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice and serve over pasta or accompanied by
                crusty bread.
